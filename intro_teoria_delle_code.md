basic concepts:
- lambda = mean arrival rate
    - customer per hour
    - oppure definito anche come time between arrival
- mu     = mean service rate
    - average number of jobs that can be handled by one server per time unit
- s (/c) = number of servers (number of queues)


... brother, what is this?







**formule varie per single server model**:

- lambda = mean arrival rate of customers
- mu     = mean service rate

- ro     = lamda / mu               = the average utilization of the system
- L      = lambda / (mu - lambda)   = the average number of customers in the service system
- L_q    = ro*L                     = the average number of customers waiting in line
- W      = 1 / (mu - L)             = the average time spent waiting in the system (including service)





**Multi server waiting line model**
